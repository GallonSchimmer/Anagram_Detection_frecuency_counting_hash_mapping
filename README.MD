## Problem Statement
An anagram is the result of rearranging the letters of a word to produce a new word, involving exactly the same letters, but in a different order (see wikipedia).

Note: Anagrams are case insensitive.

**Task**: Complete the function to return true if the two arguments given are anagrams of each other; return false otherwise.

## Examples
- "foefet" is an anagram of "toffee"
- "Buckethead" is an anagram of "DeathCubeK"


## Solution Concept
This problem is a classic example of **Frequency Counting** which is a subset of hashing used extensively in data processing and analysis. The concept involves mapping each element (e.g., character in a string) to its frequency.

**Concepts Illustrated**:
- **Hash Mapping**: Utilizing data structures like HashMap to count occurrences efficiently.
- **Normalization**: Converting all data to a common standard (e.g., lowercasing strings) to ensure uniformity in processing.
- **Conditional Logic**: Implementing checks to compare data properties such as length and character counts.

This simple algorithmic problem teaches foundational techniques for handling and analyzing data, which are applicable in:
- Data validation
- Database querying
- Cryptography (for certain applications)
